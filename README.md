# TabBuffer
TabBuffer is a chrome extension that makes intelligent tab deletion suggestions. TabBuffer is meant to help users combat "tab overload," in which far too many tabs are open within a browser at once. Created by Jothi Ramaswamy and Justin O'Dwyer and inspired by a final project in Harvard's CS 279R: Research Topics in Human Computer Interaction.
